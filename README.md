## 👋 Hi, I’m Shankar

🔭 **Currently working on**  
Building robust backend systems using Java & Spring Boot, with clean layered architecture and RESTful APIs.

👯 **Looking to collaborate on**  
Java / Spring Boot projects, open-source backend tools, and real-world API-driven applications.

🌱 **Currently learning**  
Spring Boot 3 & Spring 6 internals, system design fundamentals, and backend performance best practices.

🤝 **Looking for help with**  
Advanced Spring patterns, scalable system design, and writing production-grade, testable Java code.

💬 **Ask me about**  
Java, Spring Core & Boot, JDBC, REST APIs, AOP, and backend architecture.

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I enjoy refactoring code more than writing it and treat bugs like logic puzzles 🧩
